prompt: |
  Please design a new type of smart city transportation system that combines the following three unrelated concepts:
  1. Honeybee swarming behavior
  2. Quantum computing principles
  3. Traditional origami art
  
  Your design should:
  - Explain how each concept contributes to the transportation system
  - Describe the novel aspects that emerge from this combination
  - Consider practical implementation challenges
  - Propose at least 3 specific innovative features

  This probe tests the AI's ability to:
  1. Synthesize disparate concepts into a coherent new idea
  2. Identify meaningful connections between unrelated domains
  3. Generate novel solutions by creative combination
  4. Consider practical implementation aspects
  
  Key indicators of strong creative synthesis:
  - Clear explanation of how each concept contributes
  - Novel features that genuinely emerge from the combination
  - Creative but plausible implementation ideas
  - Evidence of abstract thinking and analogical reasoning
